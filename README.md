        In this repository you will find the foundation of what could be your next iOS App
        with HTTP CRUD functions and a basic SwiftUI view fully ready to use and work through.
        The app is missing all the database creation part, you indeed have to create your own,
        I suggest you to do it using Vapor, a very powerful framework (documentation below).
        You also need, after creating you Vapor App (you can find an already made on below),
